# Print Server Application

This project is a Java-based Print Server application. It utilizes RMI (Remote Method Invocation) for remote operations and employs token-based authentication for secure access.

# Access control
This project focuses on a role based system, where we check the access rights of users: Alice, George, and GeorgeT.

- Alice has full access to all actions while logged in. However, once she logs out, she is no longer authorized to perform any actions.
- George has access to the print function but is not allowed to stop the printer.
- GeorgeT has access to setConfig and readConfig. There are intentional delays in the clientâ€™s execution to demonstrate the functionality and handling of session tokens.

We have two different log files: one for the actions performed by the PrintServer and another for log-in attempts and session token management.
The log files now capture a complete system run, including detailed server logs for all operations.

## Prerequisites

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 11 or higher.
2. **Apache Maven**: Make sure Maven is installed and available in your system's PATH.
3. **Configuration File**:
   - Ensure the `PublicFile.json` file is properly set up in the correct directory (`src/main/java/resource/`).
